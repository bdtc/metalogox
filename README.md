# metalogox
Automatically adjusts the TeX logo and related, depending on the font.

The metalogox package extends the metalogo package to automatically adjust the appearance of the logos TeX, LaTeX, LaTeX 2Îµ , XeLaTeX, and LuaLaTeX, depending on the font detected or the option given to metalogox. Most of the serif and sans fonts listed at The LaTeX Font Catalogue are supported.

For unknown fonts, the user may specify a similar font, usually to good effect.

The code is on CTAN: https://ctan.org/pkg/metalogox
